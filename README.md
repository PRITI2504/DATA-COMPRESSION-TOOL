 Task 4 Description â€“ Run-Length Encoding (RLE) Compression and Decompression Tool

This project is developed as part of Task 4 assigned by CodTech IT Solutions during the C language internship program. The goal of this task is to implement a data compression and decompression tool using the Run-Length Encoding (RLE) technique in the C programming language. Run-Length Encoding is one of the simplest and most efficient forms of lossless data compression, commonly used in cases where data contains many repeated characters. In this technique, consecutive repeated characters are replaced with a single character followed by the number of repetitions, thereby reducing the total size of the data. This task gives students the opportunity to apply concepts of string manipulation, file handling, and loops in a real-world compression scenario.

The program is menu-driven, offering users two main options: compress a file or decompress a previously compressed file. When compression is selected, the program reads the content of an input text file (e.g., input.txt), applies the RLE algorithm, and stores the compressed result in a new output file (e.g., compressed.txt). Similarly, if decompression is selected, the program reads the compressed file and reconstructs the original content by reversing the RLE algorithm, storing the result in another output file (e.g., decompressed.txt). The tool is designed to handle character streams and basic punctuation efficiently, making it ideal for compressing simple text-based files.

The project is implemented with modular functions for compression and decompression, ensuring that the code remains organized and easy to understand. The use of file input/output operations in C helps students develop familiarity with practical data processing, while string manipulation builds a strong foundation for handling algorithm-based tasks. Furthermore, error-handling measures are included to alert users if files are missing or cannot be accessed. By working on this task, students gain hands-on experience with one of the fundamental techniques used in data encoding, and learn how software applications handle data more efficiently by reducing redundancy.

This task also strengthens the understanding of working with character arrays, conditional statements, and loops, and demonstrates how a basic algorithm like RLE can be applied in real-world situations. Through this task, students not only enhance their C programming skills but also gain a practical perspective on data optimization techniques. It also serves as a foundational experience for learning more advanced topics in data compression such as Huffman Coding or Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) algorithms.

Overall, this project fulfills the academic objectives set by CodTech IT Solutions and helps students build a robust understanding of how compression works. It highlights the importance of efficient data handling and storage, while also reinforcing key programming concepts in a structured and application-driven way.
